        It was faster than a mutux in 1 thread, 5 thread and 10 thread execution by 10% 42% and 12% respectively but was slower by 19270% when 100 threads were used. 
        For 100 threads, this is likely due to threads not sleeping but continuing to poll to see if the lock was available as the overhead increased with increase in threads.
        For 1, 5 and 10 threads, better performance using spin lock is most likely due to the cost of putting the threads to sleep and waking them up being higher than letting them stay awake and polling for the lock availability.
